/**
 * A merged pull request must be badged "merged", not "closed".
 *
 * GitHub's REST API reports a merged PR with `state: "closed"` — merged-ness
 * lives in `merged_at`, which the backend already carries through as
 * `mergedAt`. getPrState() read only `state`, so every merged PR got the red
 * "closed" badge under the Closed and All filters, saying the work had been
 * abandoned when it had actually landed. The `.pr-state.merged` style existed
 * and nothing could reach it.

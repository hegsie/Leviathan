/**
 * The working-tree lock for ref operations, shared across every surface.
 *
 * Two disjoint locks used to guard the same commands: app-shell held
 * `refOperationsInFlight` for the graph ref menu, the commit context menu and
 * the command palette, while `lv-branch-list`, `lv-tag-list` and
 * `lv-stash-list` each held their own component-local `operationInProgress`.
 * Nothing passed a busy signal between them — `<lv-left-panel>` is rendered
 * with no props at all — so a hard reset started from the graph and a
 * double-clicked sidebar checkout ran concurrently against the same working
 * tree. There is no per-repo lock in the backend (every command opens its own
 * git2 handle), and the backend's own state guards only refuse when the repo
 * is mid-merge/rebase — two operations on a Clean repo are not caught. The
 * auto-stash checkout is the worst case: it saves, applies and drops by
 * position, so a concurrent reset lands on the just-applied tree with the
 * stash entry already gone.
 *
 * This is the same hoist `maintenance-confirms.ts` already did for gc/prune,
 * and it is keyed by repository path for the same reason: separate repos have
 * separate working trees and nothing to serialize against each other.

 * do nothing except raise a refusal toast, which is the dead control this
 * whole mechanism exists to remove. Six dialogs were in that state, and the
 * hand-rolled version of the observation half (a refOpsVersion field, a
 * subscription in connectedCallback, teardown in disconnectedCallback, a
 * getter) had already been mis-applied once by a scripted edit that silently
 * skipped three files.
 *
 * A reactive controller removes the boilerplate — and with it the chance to
 * apply only part of it:
 *
 *   private lock = new RefLockController(this, () => this.pinnedRepoPath);
 *   ...
 *   ?disabled=${this.deleting || this.lock.busy}
 *
 * Bind it ONLY to the controls that START a git operation. Cancel/Close and
 * plain form inputs must stay live: `busy` reflects ANY operation anywhere in
 * the repo, so gating them greys out the most obvious way to leave a dialog —
 * or freezes a textarea mid-keystroke — for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with the dialog. lv-clean-dialog and lv-repository-health-dialog already
 * carry that decision in comments; applying the controller uniformly to every
 * binding in a footer walked straight back into it.
